# Claude project instructions

## Important first notice: limited internet data allowance

The developer is currently working with a limited internet data allowance.
Use external network access only when it is strictly necessary for the current
task and local repository files, installed dependencies, caches, and existing
documentation are insufficient. Keep the number of requests, transferred data,
and downloads to the absolute minimum. Ask for permission before any external
access that is not clearly essential.

## Project instructions

Before planning, discussing, or changing this project, read `AGENTS.md` in
full and follow all instructions and document-reading requirements defined
there. Treat `AGENTS.md` as the canonical source for project workflow, scope,
architecture, validation, and Git rules.

## Git from the sandbox: no optional locks

The sandbox cannot delete files, so a plain `git status` in this session leaves
a stale `.git/index.lock` behind that blocks the developer's next Git command.
Always use `git --no-optional-locks ...` for read-only Git commands from here
(`status`, `diff --stat`, `grep`); it refreshes nothing and leaves no lock.
